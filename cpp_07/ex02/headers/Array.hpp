// The ".tpp" include directive lets you have a special ".tpp" file where the compiler is gonna look into for the functions implementations. This can only be done
// when you have a class template. The main difference with a normal class is the way types and methods are handled. A template class is a generic class that works
// with any type; its type is defined by the compiler based on the specified type when an instance of the template is created.
// Also, the include must be after the class declaration otherwise the compiler will try to make sense of the ".tpp" file (template plus plus) before the class definition.
